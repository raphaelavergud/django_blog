# django_blog

This is my project where I experiment with django.

I have a webhook in place that automatically pushes my code to <https://raphaelavergud.pythonanywhere.com> (which is not working right now because the free version of pythonanywhere doesn't allow postgresql as a DB)

For workflows I have the Django CI in place for tests and linting.
